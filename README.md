# My First React Application using Typescript

## Description

This project is a toy project to get my hands into ReactJs using TypeScript and Material UI.

The goal was to type every single variable and not use the any keyword.

It took its inspiration from Andrew Mead's Udemy course on ReactJs.

## Start the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
